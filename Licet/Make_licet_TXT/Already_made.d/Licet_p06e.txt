I would like to ask a question to Google, as central as I can aim it.

I have plenty of evidence that the local Google employees have mostly been personnel in fine cahoots with the regime in Croatia; I have some respect only to rare exceptions among them, for the rest only my spurn, and my patience for, and relish for, the day when all will be revealed.

The question is simple:

Can I get a list of all the items of my video collection which was on "my" Youtube channel, that were in copyright breach, from your database?

Of all the titles as I named them, and if the original was named differently, that original's title too, the date that I posted them, when it was discovered, which breach of copyright in violation of whose rights it was, and to what extent of damage to those copyright holders?

Please let me know, as detailed as possible.

Also, please let me know if you are aware of any material gain (financial or other kind) that I have obtained, through or by or via what means, and when and from whom, and from exactly which of the videos on Youtube with which I "infringed" those "copyrights"?

Please, I'm really very anxious to know!

Thank you in advance!
