<markup><span face="Ubuntu" stretch="expanded" size="11500" weight="semibold" fgcolor="white">In normal countries people are generally free to communicate. But since I live under a regime in treason of its own people, communicate for me, and potentially for you to communicate with me, is more difficult business.

If my country were not (to some extent) occupied (covertly), and not led by traitors, I could just give you one email and go on with nicer and more interesting talk. But for viewers/users of the Flowstamp demonstration/program who would like to write to or read from me, I have to give a complex little story with more addresses, along with explanations and warnings.</span></markup>
